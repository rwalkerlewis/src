.SH NAME
vplot text \- A guide to using the Hershey fonts in vplot

.SH DESCRIPTION
Vplot fonts are mixtures of vectors and filled areas which simulate typeset
fonts on graphics devices.  Since they are not raster, they can be arbitrarily
scaled, stretched, skewed, and rotated, and can be plotted on any device.

There are 17 fonts.  Font 0 is just the regular old PEN font we've been using all
along.  The default font is device and installation dependent, or can be set
from the command line (see options below).
Here is a complete list of fonts and their number:

.br
0 pen
.br
1 roman simplex
.br
2 roman duplex
.br
3 roman complex
.br
4 roman triplex
.br
5 italic complex
.br
6 italic triplex
.br
7 script simplex
.br
8 script complex
.br
9 greek simplex
.br
10 greek complex
.br
11 Cyrillic complex
.br
12 German style gothic triplex
.br
13 Greek style gothic triplex
.br

Font 0 was designed by Rob Clayton at Stanford.  Fonts 1 through 16 are debugged
versions of the `Hershey' fonts available from mod.sources.  In order to
have permission to use these fonts, I must now display this message:

.SH INTERFACE
This section describes the control sequences which are accessible to any user
of
.B vplot
text, via whatever program.

Vplot text recognizes `\e' as a special character used to signal the start of
an escape sequence.  There are two sorts of escape sequences, those that take an
argument and those that do not.

Here is a complete list of escape sequences that do not take an argument:
.br
\e>	Advance one interletter space
.br
\e<	Back up one interletter space
.br
\e^	Raise one half of a capital letter height
.br
\e_	Lower one half of a capital letter height
.br
\eg	Continue processing text, but don't actually print it (`ghostify it').
This is useful if you want to leave space to go back and add something by hand.
.br
\eG	Start printing text again
.br
\en	Newline
.br
\eh	Backspace (control-h also works) back up over the last character
.br
\e-	Does nothing; used to prevent a group of characters from being formed
into a ligature.
.br
\e\e	Print a backslash
.br

The following take an integer argument immediately after, with a
.B required space
after the integer to delineate the end.  This space is not printed.

.br
\es	Size change.  Change to this percent of the size set in the text vplot
call.  \es100  restores the default height.
.br
\ef	Add this to current fatness.  Goes out of effect when text printing is
finished.
.br
\eF	Switch to this font number.  (-1 restores the default font).
.br
\ek	Move by this many space widths to the right (in percent; 100 =
one space width). Negative numbers are allowed (moves left).
.br
\er	Move up this many character heights (in percent; 100 =
the height of a standard capital letter, such as `A').
Negative numbers are allowed (moves down).
.br
\ev	Print this ASCII character number in the current font, stripping it
of any special meaning.
This and ligatures are the only way that glyphs numbered
greater than 255 are available.
.br
\ec	Switch to this color.  -1 restores the current drawing color.
Vplot's current drawing color is not changed by changing the color inside text.
.br
\em	Save current position in this number register.
.br
\eM	Restore position saved in this number register.
.br

.SH EXAMPLES
Since programs such as `graph' do not interpret text themselves, but
rely on vplot to do it, the above control sequences may simply be used wherever
any graphics text is used.  For example, instead of specifying as an option to
graph label=`beta', you can specify label=`\eF9 b' and actually get the Greek
letter beta from the Greek Simplex font.

	Here are some more examples:

	To get an integral sign:
.br
	\eF15 \ev168 
.br
	Translation: Switch to font 15 (math symbols), print character #168 (integral
sign).

	To get `X squared plus Y squared':
.br
	X\e^2\e_ + Y\e^2
.br
	Translation: Print X, go up half, print 2, go back down half, print +,
print Y, go up half, print 2.

	As an advanced example, to get `A sub b sup beta':
.br
	A\em1 \e_b\eM1 \e^\eF9 b
.br
	Translation: Do A, save this spot, go down half, do b, restore the
saved spot, go up half, switch to font 9 (Greek Simplex) do beta.  (Notice
the use of marks to stack characters on top of each other.)

	Warning: \e is a special character in C.  To get a backslash, you
have to use \e\e.

.SH GENERIC PEN OPTIONS

.TP
.B txsquare=yes
Xscale and yscale would distort text along with the entire plot
if they were applied completely consistently,
which is usually not desired.
To avoid this, the option
.B ``txsquare=yes'',
is defaulted. This causes
xscale and yscale to be forced
equal to the minimum of the two
for the purposes of text.
If
.B ``txsquare=no''
is set, then text will stretch consistently with everything else.

.TP
.B txfont=font_number
Txfont specifies the default text font.
The default is device and installation
dependent.  Generally, screen devices will default to the `pen' font since it is
by far the fastest to draw, and hardcopy devices will default to either
roman simplex
or roman complex since these are the closest to looking like standard typeset
text.  Out-of-range font
numbers (starting at 100) may be used in a device-dependent fashion
to access hardware fonts on devices that have them. Devices that don't have
hardware fonts will use the font number modulo 100.
Fonts 0-99 are guaranteed device-independent.

.TP
.B txprec=0
Txprec specifies the default text precision (a GKS term).
Possible values are character (0), string (1), and stroke (2).
For vector fonts, the text precision parameter is ignored except that
ligatures are only enabled at precision 2.  The precision parameter
may be significant if device-dependent hardware fonts are used,
however.  The default precision is device and installation dependent.

.TP
.B txovly=0
Txovly sets the default text overlay mode.
This controls whether or not to clear out an area behind the
text before writing it, and whether or not to put a box around it.
Overlay modes 1 and 3 draw a box, and modes 2 and 3 shade the inside of
the box with the background color.  The default text overlay mode is 0
(do nothing).
All text overlay modes may not be supported on all devices.
(Some devices cannot shade to background color, for example.)

The default font, default precision, and default text overlay mode may all be
reset by the appropriate vplot command.

.TP
.B fontN=file_name
The binary format vplot font file for font number N is located in file_name.
If the font number is not one normally defined on the system, file_name
defaults to fontN, where again N is the font number. If the device does
not have hardware fonts, the font number modulo 100 will be used
for all internal purposes (so fonts 201 and 101 must be the same,
for example). The N in the above option will still be the
original font number, however. Fonts that are included
at compile time are hardwired and cannot be changed.

.SH LIGATURES
Fonts may specify that certain combinations of adjacent glyphs be combined into
a single new glyph whenever they occur.  For example, `ffi' in font 3 (it's
a ligature in troff, too).  This
takes place automatically at precision 2.
The only fonts which currently contain
ligatures are the Roman Complex, Italic Complex, and Cyrillic Complex fonts.
You can prevent a group of letters from being
formed into a ligature by breaking them up using the ``\e-'' special
sequence (just like in TeX).
(Ligatures may be used in fonts for foreign languages to good effect to
automatically de-transliterate English approximations.  For example, `sh' in
the Cyrillic font automatically comes out as a single Shah character.
`KHrushchev', for example, contains only 6 glyphs: KH-r-u-shch-e-v.
The K and H here are both
capitalized since they are both part of the first character.  The `Tests'
directory contains the example TEST_Cyrillic which shows how to generate
every letter in the Cyrillic alphabet.)

.SH TEXT JUSTIFICATION
Text justification is set by the appropriate command in vplot, and follows
the GKS standard.
Since this text routine allows character size and active font to
be changed within a single text string, the GKS standard is extended so that
`TOP' and `BOTTOM' alignments align on the highest top and the lowest
bottom of the characters used.  (Note that this makes the alignment font and
size dependent, but not dependent on the actual characters used.)
The `CAP' and `HALF' alignments are determined
by those for the default font.

All sizes of all fonts are aligned together by their baselines.

Horizontal alignment is based according to the beginning and ending horizontal
positions.  You can use marks to make the ending position be anywhere in the
string you wish.

A `SYMBOL' justification mode has also been added to those defined by GKS.
Each glyph has a `hot
spot' defined, which is where the glyph is to be centered if it is used as
a symbol.  The last printable character in a string is the character centered on
as the symbol.  To center on a character in the middle
of the string as a symbol, mark the spot with the \em command immediately after that
character and then restore that location at the end of the string with the
\eM command.  That character
is now the `last character' as far as all centering is concerned.
Size changes and horizontal
shifts are taken into account
in the symbol justification mode, but shifts up and down are not.

Vplot polymarkers are drawn by setting the SYMBOL text justification mode,
setting the correct font,
creating a special single-character string, and
then calling the text routine to draw the symbol.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Nonexistent glyphs are rendered as a special `error' glyph.  Which glyph is
used for this is installation dependent, and is set by defines in
gentext.c.  As distributed, it is glyph 30 in font 0, which is a `?' inside
a diamond.  (I stole this idea from the Imagen laser printer.)  An error message
will be produced the first time that a nonexistent glyph is referenced.
(Only the first time so that you don't get overwhelmed with error messages
if you're trying to use a font that doesn't exist on that system.)
Attempts to use nonexistent fonts produce
an error message and font 0 (or whatever other font has been
designated as the error font in gentext.c) is used instead.

Various other non-fatal errors can occur and all
give self-explanatory error messages.

.SH COPYRIGHT
The Vplot source code is copyrighted. Please read the copyright notice you
will find in the Vplot manual page.

.SH FONT FILES
Font files used by the vplot text subroutine `gentext' are kept in
.../vplot/filters/include/vplotfonts/*.  There are two forms for each font,
an `include' form and a `binary' form.  The include form is compiled in
as an #include file into gentext.  This is more efficient, but makes the
executable code considerably longer and slows down compilation.
The binary form is loaded on the fly as
needed at runtime.  Which method is used for which font is system dependent
and is determined by the file .../vplot/include/font_definitions.h.

If for some reason when you run a pen filter it cannot find the
runtime-loaded fonts (or if you want to set up your own version of those fonts)
you can set your own vplot binary font directory using the environmental
variable ``VPLOTFONTDIR''.
(Note the font directory name in the variable will usually
end with a slash!)

.SH ASSOCIATED PROGRAMS
The subroutine
.B gentext.c
is the device-independent generic subroutine that vplot uses to draw
vector fonts.
Gentext.c is constructed in such a way that it could easily be fit into a GKS
package.  While the standard text command in Vplot thinks in terms
of `text orientation' and
`text size', gentext thinks in terms of `character up vectors' and
`character path vectors'.  Squashed, slanted, etc, text can be produced
by having these two vectors not be perpendicular or not the same length.
An alternative text command is provided that uses this
more general method of text specification.

The program
.B makefont.c
takes a `vplot font' and encodes it into the forms required by gentext.
The format of a `vplot font' is designed such that it can be read into the
program `plas'
and then piped into a vplot filter.  IE, the command
.br
plas < cyrilc.vplot_font | ?pen xcenter=0 ycenter=0 scale=50 pause=1
.br
will display each glyph in the cyrillic font, one per second.
.br
Fonts 10 |plas|Tube will display the numbers of all greek letters fonts.

The exact format of a `vplot font' file is given in comments at the beginning of
makefont.c, and the file pen.vplot_font serves as an example.
Since vplot_fonts are just open-format vplot files, it is very easy to create your
own special purpose glyphs, markers, or fonts and add these to the system.

The program
.B hertovplot.c
converts `Hershey' font data as distributed by mod.sources
(mod.sources is a UNIX network `news' group for distributing
useful UNIX software.)
into vplot fonts.
Its use is described in comments at the beginning of the program.
The program
.B hertogrid.c
draws all the glyphs in a Hershey glyph file on a grid, labeling each glyph
with its number.  (The Hershey glyph files have to be organized into reasonable
fonts by hand! The organization of my fonts mostly follows those provided by
Mr. Hurt, but I have added in a few things he missed
and reordered the non-English
fonts to make more sense.  I have stolen bits of Mr. Hurt's code to write
hertovplot.c and hertogrid.c.)

.SH FONT INSTALLATION
To install all the fonts, you must first obtain the Hershey fonts for
yourself
as distributed by mod.sources (if you don't know how to get stuff
from them, then how did you get this file that you're reading now?).
Follow the instructions to create the
four `.oc' files, and copy these into the .../vplot/Hershey directory.
Do not copy the `.hmp' files.
Follow the instructions you will find in the file .../vplot/Hershey/README
to make all the required `vplot_font's.
(Note that pen.vplot_font is not part of the Hershey font distribution.
This font was created by Rob Clayton around 1980, and slightly modified
by Joe Dellinger in 1986.)
Once you have done this,
go into the .../vplot/filters/include/vplotfonts directory, and
do `make'.  This will create the required `.include' and `.bin'
fonts.

You may ask me for advice if you wish to help do any of the things in
the wish list below.

.SH BUGS
The letter `J' in the Roman Triplex font in the Hershey font distribution
has mangled width information.  The vplot font for this font has to be edited by
hand to correct this mistake.

Gentext.c does not yet support all the required GKS features.  However, as all
the internal calculations are done in a way consistent with the GKS model
modifying the code to support these is a very straightforward job which I
leave to someone else.

Somebody should make sure that all the `hot spots' defined for characters
are reasonable.  (The `hot spot' is the point that is aligned on when
symbol alignment mode is used.)
(The ones installed now are the defaults chosen by
makefont.c.)  Somebody should create a special `polymarker' font.
Currently several of the more esoteric symbols called by the vplot
polymarker command are not very well centered (notably triangles).

Somebody should write an interactive program to create new glyphs with.

Somebody should turn some of the better Hershey vector fonts into filled-area
fonts.  (Unfortunately, Mr. Hershey didn't see fit to order his vectors in such
a way as to make this easy.) The only thing lacking is the font itself,
because vplot itself already supports arbitrary mixtures of filled-areas
and vectors in fonts.  Currently there are just a few glyphs containing
filled areas in font 0, as examples showing how to do it.

Dr. Geller (the first tenured American professor at a Japanese university,
and a former Stanford Earth Sciences professor)
should have his students create a katakana and a hirigana font.
Ligatures can be used to pair the appropriate consonant-vowel pairs.
There are also quite a few Kanji glyphs available as well, from which a Kanji
font could be constructed.
A ligature could be constructed to turn each English word into its Kanji
equivalent! (The number of glyphs in a font is not limited to 256! That's
why I did things that way.)

Somebody should extend the way ligatures are read from vplot font files,
so that you can just give the
ASCII character itself instead of the glyph number
if one exists.  Since I only had a few ligatures I didn't want to bother with
this.
