Program sfwigb | X WIGgle-trace plot of f(x1,x2) via Bitmap.

X Functionality:							
Button 1	Zoom with rubberband box				
Button 2	Show mouse (x1,x2) coordinates while pressed		
q or Q key	Quit							
s key		Save current mouse (x1,x2) location to file		
p or P key	Plot current window with pswigb (only from disk files)	
a or page up keys		enhance clipping by 10%			
c or page down keys		reduce clipping by 10%			
up,down,left,right keys	move zoom window by half width/height	
i or +(keypad) 		zoom in by factor 2 			
o or -(keypad) 		zoom out by factor 2 			
l 				lock the zoom while moving the coursor	
u 				unlock the zoom 			
1,2,...,9	Zoom/Move factor of the window size			
									
Notes:								
	Reaching the window limits while moving within changes the zoom	
	factor in this direction. The use of zoom locking(l) disables it
