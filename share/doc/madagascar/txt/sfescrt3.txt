Program sfescrt3 | Escape tables by ray tracing with escape equations in 3-D. 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfescrt3 < spdom.rsf > out.rsf traj=traj.rsf vspl=vspline.rsf na=360 nb=180 df=0.1 md=SF_HUGE aper=SF_HUGE nc=0 parab=y verb=n nt=1001 dt=0.001
[PARAMETERS]
float   | aper | =SF_HUGE |   | 	Maximum aperture in x and y directions from current point (default - up to model boundaries) 
float   | df | =0.1 |   | 	< Maximum distance to travel per step (fraction of the cell size) >
float   | dt | =0.001 |   | 	Time sampling 
float   | md | =SF_HUGE |   | 	Maximum distance for a ray to travel (default - up to model boundaries) 
int     | na | =360 |   | 	Number of azimuth phase angles 
int     | nb | =180 |   | 	Number of inclination phase angles 
int     | nc | =0 |   | 	Number of threads to use for ray tracing (OMP_NUM_THREADS by default) 
int     | nt | =1001 |   | 	Number of time samples for each trajectory 
bool    | parab | =y |  [y/n] | 	y - use parabolic approximation of trajectories, n - straight line 
string  | traj | = |   | 	Trajectory output (auxiliary output file name)
bool    | verb | =n |  [y/n] | 	verbosity flag 
string  | vspl | = |   | 	Spline coefficients for velocity model (auxiliary input file name)
