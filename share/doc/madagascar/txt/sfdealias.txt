Program sfdealias | 3-D trace interpolation to a denser grid using PWD.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfdealias < in.rsf > out.rsf dip=dip.rsf both=n eps=0.01 order=1
[COMMENTS]

It may be necessary to bandpass the data before and after dealiasing 
to ensure that the temporal spectrum is banded. Rule of thumb: if 
max(jx,jy)=N, the temporal bandwidth should be 1/N of Nyquist.
