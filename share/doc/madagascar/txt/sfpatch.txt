Program sfpatch | Patching (N-dimensional). 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfpatch < in.rsf > out.rsf n0= w= p= inv=n verb=n weight=n dim=dim0
[COMMENTS]

w is window size (defaults to n1,n2,...)
p is number of patches in different dimensions (defaults to 1,1,...)

If inv=n, the number of output dimensions is twice the number of input dimensions.
If inv=y, the number of output dimensions is half the number of input dimensions.
