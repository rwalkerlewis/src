Program sfboolcmp | Element-wise boolean comparison of values. For int/float/complex data-sets.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfboolcmp < in.rsf > out.rsf right_f= eps=0 right= sign=
[COMMENTS]
This program will solve the solution to this problem:
- [input] [sign] [right]
- sfboolcmp <left.rsf sign=ge right=right.rsf 
- left.rsf >= right.rsf
This will return a vector of same length as left and return 0's or 1's depending on the result of the inequality.  Optionally you can supply a right_f parameter to compare the input data to a single value.

[PARAMETERS]
float   | eps | =0 |   | 	comparing within this range epsilon 
string  | right | = |   | 	the rsf file you will be comparing to 
float   | right_f | = |   | 	compare input (left) to a single float value (right) 
string  | sign | = |   | 	'eq'(default),'gt','ge','lq','lt','ne'
        sign=   'eq' equal-to ( == )
        sign=   'gt' greater-than ( > )
        sign=   'ge' greater-than or equal-to ( >= )
        sign=   'lq' less-than or equal-to ( <= )
        sign=   'lt' less-than ( < )
        sign=   'ne' not-equal ( != )
	sign=   'and' the values are both non-zero ( && )
	sign=   'or' one value is non-zero ( !! )
