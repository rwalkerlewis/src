Program sfkirchnew | Kirchhoff 2-D post-stack time migration and modeling with antialiasing. 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfkirchnew < in.rsf > out.rsf velocity=vel.rsf adj=y hd=y sw=0 v0=
[COMMENTS]

Antialiasing by reparameterization. 
[PARAMETERS]
bool    | adj | =y |  [y/n] | 	yes: migration, no: modeling 
bool    | hd | =y |  [y/n] | 	if y, apply half-derivative filter 
int     | sw | =0 |   | 	if > 0, select a branch of the antialiasing operation 
float   | v0 | = |   | 	constant velocity (if no velocity=) 
string  | velocity | = |   | 	velocity file (auxiliary input file name)
