Program sfmpistack | stacks rsf files of the same dimensionality using mpi 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfmpistack mode=0 verb=n seq=n nf= jf=1 of=0 shots= prefix= oname=
[COMMENTS]

Mode specifies whether to add, multiply, divide or subtract.

mode=0 - add
mode=1 - multiply

If useprefix is set, then:

assume that files are commonly named sequentially, e.g.:

File001.rsf
File002.rsf
File003.rsf ...
FileN.rsf

Such that all files can be represented as a prefix, which 
is a printf like statement that will be evaluated for all
files to be included in a range.

For the above example the prefix would be:

prefix="File%03d.rsf" 

The nf, jf, and of parameters specify a range of numbers to evaluate the 
prefix for, giving the program filenames to be used for summing
together.  For example:  

nf=10,of=0,jf=1 --> (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
nf=10,of=5,jf=2 --> (5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23)

If there are more files than processes, then this program will subdivide
the files onto various processes, and run multiple rounds until
everything is done.

This program does not care about dimensionality!  It treats every file
as a 1D array and writes out a 1D array, and then modifies the header
to match the input file size.
