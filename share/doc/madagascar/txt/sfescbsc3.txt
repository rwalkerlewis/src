float   | dx | = |   | 	Sampling of x axis 
float   | dy | = |   | 	Sampling of y axis 
float   | dz | = |   | 	Sampling of z axis 
float   | md | =dz |   | 	Half-width of a supercell 
int     | na | = |   | 	Number of samples in azimuth dimension 
int     | nb | = |   | 	Number of samples in inclination dimension 
int     | nc | =0 |   | 	Number of threads to use for ray tracing (OMP_NUM_THREADS by default)
