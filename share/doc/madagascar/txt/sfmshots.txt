Program sfmshots | 2-D prestack forward modeling using sponge ABC using 4-th order FD
[SYNOPSIS]
sfmshots < vinit.rsf > shots.rsf amp=1000 fm=10 nb=30 dt= nt= ns= ng= jsx= jsz=0 jgx=1 jgz=0 sxbeg= szbeg= gxbeg= gzbeg= csdgather=n mute=n vmute=1500 tdmute=2.0/(fm*dt)
[COMMENTS]
NB: prepare high quality prestack seismic data for LSRTM and FWI
Top boundary is free surface (no ABC applied)!

[PARAMETERS]
float   | amp | =1000 |   | 	maximum amplitude of ricker 
bool    | csdgather | =n |  [y/n] | 	default, common shot-gather; if n, record at every point 
float   | dt | = |   | 	time interval 
float   | fm | =10 |   | 	dominant freq of ricker 
int     | gxbeg | = |   | 	x-begining index of receivers, starting from 0 
int     | gzbeg | = |   | 	z-begining index of receivers, starting from 0 
int     | jgx | =1 |   | 	receiver x-axis jump interval 
int     | jgz | =0 |   | 	receiver z-axis jump interval 
int     | jsx | = |   | 	source x-axis  jump interval  
int     | jsz | =0 |   | 	source z-axis jump interval  
bool    | mute | =n |  [y/n] | 	if yes, muting the direct arrivals 
int     | nb | =30 |   | 	thickness of sponge ABC  
int     | ng | = |   | 	total receivers in each shot 
int     | ns | = |   | 	total shots 
int     | nt | = |   | 	total modeling time steps 
int     | sxbeg | = |   | 	x-begining index of sources, starting from 0 
int     | szbeg | = |   | 	z-begining index of sources, starting from 0 
int     | tdmute | =2.0/(fm*dt) |   | 	number of deleyed time samples to mute 
float   | vmute | =1500 |   | 	muting velocity to remove the low-freq artifacts, unit=m/s
