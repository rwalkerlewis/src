Program sfstack | Stack a dataset over one of the dimensions.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfstack < in.rsf > out.rsf scale= axis=2 rms=n norm=y min=n max=n prod=n
[COMMENTS]

This operation is adjoint to sfspray.

[PARAMETERS]
int     | axis | =2 |   | 	which axis to stack. If axis=0, stack over all dimensions 
bool    | max | =n |  [y/n] | 	If y, find maximum instead of stack.  Ignores rms and norm. 
bool    | min | =n |  [y/n] | 	If y, find minimum instead of stack.  Ignores rms and norm. 
bool    | norm | =y |  [y/n] | 	If y, normalize by fold. 
bool    | prod | =n |  [y/n] | 	If y, find product instead of stack.  Ignores rms and norm. 
bool    | rms | =n |  [y/n] | 	If y, compute the root-mean-square instead of stack. 
floats  | scale | = |   | 	optionally scale before stacking  [n2]
