[SYNOPSIS]
sfmulawefd2d < Fwav.rsf vel=Fvel.rsf sou1=Fsou1.rsf sou2=Fsou2.rsf rec=Frec.rsf > Fdat.rsf wfl=Fwfl.rsf den=Fden.rsf verb=n snap=n free=n dabc=n cden=n jdata=1 jsnap=nt nqz=sf_n(az) nqx=sf_n(ax) oqz=sf_o(az) oqx=sf_o(ax)
[COMMENTS]
4th order in space, 2nd order in time. Absorbing boundary conditions.
Invisible parameter due to self-doc parsing bug: 
nb=[2] Boundary padding in grid points
