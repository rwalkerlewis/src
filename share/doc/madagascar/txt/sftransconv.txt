[SYNOPSIS]
sftransconv < _in.rsf > _out.rsf trans=_trans.rsf ker=_ker.rsf adj=n x1=0. x2=0.
[COMMENTS]
program translates a 2D image then convolves it with arbitrary kernel

[PARAMETERS]
bool    | adj | =n |  [y/n] | 	if y reverse translation, if n, translation 
string  | ker | = |   | 	convolution kernel file (auxiliary input file name)
string  | trans | = |   | 	variable translations file with same sampling as input, added ndim dimension (auxiliary input file name)
float   | x1 | =0. |   | 	fixed translation in first dimension 
float   | x2 | =0. |   | 	fixed translation in second dimension
