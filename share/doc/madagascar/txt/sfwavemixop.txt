[SYNOPSIS]
sfwavemixop < Fw.rsf > Fo.rsf ref=Fr.rsf snaps=Fs.rsf left=left.rsf right=right.rsf alpha=Fa.rsf beta=Fb.rsf verb=n snap=0 correct=n type=0 pad1=1 mode=
[PARAMETERS]
file    | alpha | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | beta | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
bool    | correct | =n |  [y/n] | 	jingwei's correction
file    | left | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
string  | mode | = |   | 	default mode is pspi 
int     | pad1 | =1 |   | 	padding factor on the first axis 
file    | ref | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | right | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
int     | snap | =0 |   | 	interval for snapshots 
file    | snaps | = |   | 	auxiliary output file name
int     | type | =0 |   | 	type of propagation; 0 means no correction applied, and mode takes effect, 9 enables jjsf
bool    | verb | =n |  [y/n] | 	verbosity
