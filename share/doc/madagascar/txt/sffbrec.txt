Program sffbrec | Forward-backword exact reconstruction using boundary saving
[SYNOPSIS]
sffbrec < vinit.rsf > Fw1.rsf back=Fw2.rsf amp=1000 fm=10 dt= nt= ns=1 ng= jsx= jsz=0 jgx=1 jgz=0 sxbeg= szbeg= gxbeg= gzbeg= csdgather=y ft=0 jt=1
[COMMENTS]
Note: It is used as a demonstration that we can reconstruct the modeled
wavefield exactly via boundary saving.
