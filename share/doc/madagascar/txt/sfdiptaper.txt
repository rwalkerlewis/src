Program sfdiptaper | Aperture optimization for migrated gathers in the dip-angle domain.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfdiptaper < dipFile.rsf > taperFile.rsf dz=20.f greyarea=10.f
[COMMENTS]

Estimates a constructive imaging part of a reflection event in the dip-angle domain.
Basing on the estimation defines a stacking weight for every migrated sample.

Input:
dipFile.rsf - dips esitimated in constant-dip subimages. The dips are in degree (!).
A positive dip corresponds to an ascending boundary, a negative dip - to a descending boundary.
A constant-dip subimage consists of migrated traces correspondig to the same dip-angle.

Output:
taperFile.rsf - optimal weights for the migrated samples

[PARAMETERS]
float   | dz | =20.f |   | 	half of a migrated wave length 
float   | greyarea | =10.f |   | 	width of event tail taper (in degree)
