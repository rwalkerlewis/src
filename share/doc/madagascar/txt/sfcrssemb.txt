Program sfcrssemb | CRS-based semblance
[SYNOPSIS]
sfcrssemb < inDags_.rsf dataSq=inDagsSq_.rsf > sembFile_.rsf xapp=1 dipapp=11 coher=11 scatnum=1 s1= s2=
[COMMENTS]

Several CIGs are used simultaneously. Dip-angle sections corresponding to the same 
dip-angle compose a subvolume. The subvolume allows calculating semblance in the
scattering-angle direction along reflection boundaries.

Input:
inDags_.rsf   - dip-angle gathers - stack in the scattering-angle direction
InDagsSq_.rsf - stack of amplitude squares in the scattering-angle direction

Working with just dip-angle gathers use default value of "scatnum" parameter

Output:
sembFile_.rsf - crs-based semblance file; has the same dimensions as the input files

[PARAMETERS]
int     | coher | =11 |   | 	height of a vertical window for semblance calculation 
file    | dataSq | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
int     | dipapp | =11 |   | 	number of traces in the x-dip direction processed simultaneously 
float   | s1 | = |   | 	
float   | s2 | = |   | 	
int     | scatnum | =1 |   | 	shows how many traces were stacked in the scattering angle direction; 
       if the stack was normalized use the default value 
    
int     | xapp | =1 |   | 	number of CIGs in the inline-direction processed simultaneously
