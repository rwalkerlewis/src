sfspitzblns < in.rsf > out.rsf w1=n1 w2=n2 k1=1 k2=1 order=3 ntraces=1 f1=0.0 f2=1.0 verb=n norm=y
[COMMENTS]
based on Seismic trace interpolation in the F-X domain
S.Spitz Geophysics 56, 785(1991). 

Uses 2D Patching. 

[PARAMETERS]
float   | f1 | =0.0 |   | 	lower  frequency in band limited signal >= 0.0  
float   | f2 | =1.0 |   | 	higher frequency in band limited signal <= 1.0  (normalized nyquist)
int     | k1 | =1 |   | 	number of patches along the first dimension 
int     | k2 | =1 |   | 	number of patches along the second dimension 
bool    | norm | =y |  [y/n] | 	output normalization flag 
int     | ntraces | =1 |   | 	number of traces to be interpolated 
int     | order | =3 |   | 	linear PEF order
bool    | verb | =n |  [y/n] | 	verbosity flag 
int     | w1 | =n1 |   | 	lenght of patch along the first dimension 
int     | w2 | =n2 |   | 	lenght of patch along the second dimension
