[PARAMETERS]
float   | ax | = |   | 	Gaussian weight for the range distance 
bool    | boundary | =y |  [y/n] | 	if y, boundary is data, whereas zero
float   | bx | = |   | 	exponential weight for the domain distance (different if gaussian)
file    | dip | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
bool    | gauss | =n |  [y/n] | 	if y, Gaussian weight, whereas Triangle weight 
int     | nfw | = |   | 	filter-window length (positive and odd integer) 
int     | nw | = |   | 	data-window length (positive and odd integer) 
int     | repeat | =1 |   | 	repeat filtering several times
