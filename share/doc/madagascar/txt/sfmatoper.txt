Program sfmatoper | Matrix algebra operation
[SYNOPSIS]
sfmatoper < in.rsf mat=mat.rsf > out.rsf type=
[COMMENTS]
Implement C=Oper(A,B).
Specially, when "Oper" stands for multiplication, C=AB,  where: 
C is a m*k matrix, m corresponds to dimension 2 while k corrsponds to dimension 1.
A is a m*n matrix, m corresponds to dimension 2 while n corrsponds to dimension 1.
B is a n*k matrix, n corresponds to dimension 2 while k corrsponds to dimension 1.
Like matlab matrix operation.
