Program sfinmo3gma | 3-D Inverse generalized normal moveout.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfinmo3gma < cmp.rsf > nmod.rsf velocity=vel.rsf half=n eps=0.01 extend=8
[COMMENTS]
Velocity file contains slowness squared with n2=16 (wx,wxy,wy,A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5)
following Sripanich and Fomel (2015).

[PARAMETERS]
float   | eps | =0.01 |   | 	stretch regularization 
int     | extend | =8 |   | 	trace extension 
bool    | half | =n |  [y/n] | 	if x,y , the second and third axes are half-offset instead of full offset
