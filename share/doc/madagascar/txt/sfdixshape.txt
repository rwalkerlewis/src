Program sfdixshape | Convert RMS to interval velocity using LS and shaping regularization.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfdixshape < vrms.rsf > vint.rsf weight=weight.rsf dip=dip.rsf prior=prior.rsf vrmsout=vout.rsf rect1=3 rect2=3 lam=1. order=1 niter=100 rect1= rect2= ...
[COMMENTS]
rectN defines the size of the smoothing stencil in N-th dimension.
