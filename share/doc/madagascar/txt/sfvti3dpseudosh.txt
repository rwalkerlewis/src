Program sfvti3dpseudosh | 3-D three-components wavefield modeling using pure mode SH-wave equation in 3D VTI media.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfvti3dpseudosh < Fvp0.rsf vs0=Fvs0.rsf epsi=Fep.rsf del=Fde.rsf gam=Fga.rsf > Fo1.rsf SHy=Fo2.rsf SH=Fo3.rsf ns=301 dt=0.001 bd=20
[COMMENTS]
* Note: The z-components of pure-mode qSV-wave are zero.
