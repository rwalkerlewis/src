Program sfsepcmplx2rsf | Convert legacy SEPlib complex datasets to RSF
[SYNOPSIS]
sfsepcmplx2rsf file= preserve_t=y verb=n
[COMMENTS]

I.e. from 

esize=8 data_format=xdr_float

to 

esize=8 data_format=xdr_complex 

This combination is tolerated by SEPlib versions released after 2011-01-20,
and required by all versions of Madagascar. Previous to the date above, it
was impossible to have a complex single-precision dataset that was valid both
in SEPlib and Madagascar

This program opens the SEPlib file in read-write mode!

Handles in=stdin case (header and data in one file)

[PARAMETERS]
string  | file | = |   | 	Name of file to process
bool    | preserve_t | =y |  [y/n] | 	Whether to preserve timestamp
bool    | verb | =n |  [y/n] | 	Say if file was converted or unchanged
