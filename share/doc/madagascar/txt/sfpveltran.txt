[PARAMETERS]
file    | dip | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | dipt | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
float   | dv | = |   | 	velocity sampling 
float   | eps | =0.1 |   | 	stretch regularization 
bool    | half | =y |  [y/n] | 	if y, the second axis is half-offset instead of full offset 
bool    | interval | =n |  [y/n] | 	if y, compute interval velocity 
int     | nv | = |   | 	number of velocities 
float   | v0 | = |   | 	velocity origin
