Program sfmultiple | 2-D shot gather multiple prediction (SRMP)
[SYNOPSIS]
sfmultiple < in.rsf > out.rsf dif=dif.rsf verb=n stack=n both=n jumpo=1 jumps=1
[COMMENTS]
The axes in the input are {offset,shot,frequency}
The axes in the output are {prediction(if stack=n),offset,shot,frequency}
Requirement: offset interval = shot interval

[PARAMETERS]
bool    | both | =n |  [y/n] | 	receiver flag, if y, receiver with both sides 
string  | dif | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
int     | jumpo | =1 |   | 	jump in offset dimension, only for stack=n 
int     | jumps | =1 |   | 	jump in shot dimension, only for stack=n  
bool    | stack | =n |  [y/n] | 	stack flag, if y, no common multiple gather 
bool    | verb | =n |  [y/n] | 	verbosity flag
