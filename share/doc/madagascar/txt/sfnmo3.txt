Program sfnmo3 | 3-D Normal moveout.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfnmo3 < cmp.rsf > nmod.rsf velocity=vel.rsf offset=offset.rsf half=y eps=0.01 mute=12 extend=8
[COMMENTS]

input data has gathers along *4th* axis; 
velocity file contains slowness squared with n2=3 (wx,wy,wxy);
offset file contains x,y offset pairs for input data

[PARAMETERS]
float   | eps | =0.01 |   | 	stretch regularization 
int     | extend | =8 |   | 	trace extension 
bool    | half | =y |  [y/n] | 	if y, the second and third axes are half-offset instead of full offset 
int     | mute | =12 |   | 	mute zone 
string  | offset | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | velocity | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
