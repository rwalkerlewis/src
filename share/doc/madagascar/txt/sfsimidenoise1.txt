Program sfsimidenoise1 | Random noise attenuation using local similarity (different weighting approach) 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfsimidenoise1 < in.rsf > out.rsf similarity=simi.rsf s1= s2=
[COMMENTS]
The weighting function is defined as
W(s) = 1				if s>s2
	 = (s-s1)/(s2-s1)	if s1<=s<=s2
	 = 0				if s<s1

[PARAMETERS]
float   | s1 | = |   | 	thresholding level 1 
float   | s2 | = |   | 	thresholding level 2 
file    | similarity | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
