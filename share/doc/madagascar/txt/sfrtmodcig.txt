[PARAMETERS]
float   | amp | =1. |   | 	maximum amplitude of ricker wavelet
bool    | csdgather | =y |  [y/n] | 	default, common shot-gather; if n, record at every point
float   | dt | = |   | 	time interval 
float   | fm | = |   | 	dominant freq of ricker 
int     | gxbeg | = |   | 	x-begining index of receivers, starting from 0 
int     | gzbeg | = |   | 	z-begining index of receivers, starting from 0 
int     | jgx | =1 |   | 	receiver x-axis jump interval 
int     | jgz | =0 |   | 	receiver z-axis jump interval 
int     | jsx | = |   | 	source x-axis  jump interval  
int     | jsz | =0 |   | 	source z-axis jump interval  
int     | kt | =200 |   | 	record poynting vector at kt 
int     | nb | =20 |   | 	thickness of split PML 
int     | ng | = |   | 	total receivers in each shot 
int     | nh | =30 |   | 	number of points in offset coordinate
int     | ns | = |   | 	total shots 
int     | nt | = |   | 	total modeling time steps 
int     | sxbeg | = |   | 	x-begining index of sources, starting from 0 
int     | szbeg | = |   | 	z-begining index of sources, starting from 0 
int     | tdmute | =2./(fm*dt) |   | 	number of deleyed time samples to mute 
file    | vel1stlayer | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
float   | vmute | =1500 |   | 	muting velocity to remove the low-freq noise, unit=m/s
