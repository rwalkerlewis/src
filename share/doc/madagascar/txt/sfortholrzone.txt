Program sfortholrzone | Lowrank decomposition for 3-D orthorhombic wave propagation with zone's approximation. 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfortholrzone < c11.rsf seta1=seta1.rsf fft=fft.rsf left=left.rsf > right.rsf seed=time(NULL eps=1.e-4 npk=20 dt= mode=0 tilt=false approx=false reduce=false
[PARAMETERS]
        | approx | =false |   | 	if true, use zone's approximation instead of exact phase velocity
        | dt | = |   | 	time step
        | eps | =1.e-4 |   | 	tolerance
file    | fft | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | left | = |   | 	auxiliary output file name
        | mode | =0 |   | 	'0' means quasi-P (default), '1' means quasi-S, '2' means quasi-S2
        | npk | =20 |   | 	maximum rank
        | reduce | =false |   | 	if true, use the expirical linear relationship between qv and qh
        | seed | =time(NULL |   | 	
file    | seta1 | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
        | tilt | =false |   |
