[COMMENTS]
regularization (or preconditioning) operator: 
reg=0: no regularization; 
reg=1: regularization => first derivative along offset axis;
reg=2: precondition => causual integration along offset axis;
reg=3: precondition => triangle smoother along offset axis, 
reg=4: precondition => local slope constraints along t-x plane and smoothing along offset axis
