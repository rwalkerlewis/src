Program sfhandvel2rsf | Converts 2D/3D velocity files from handvel.txt to handvel.rsf
[SYNOPSIS]
sfhandvel2rsf n1= o1= d1=
[COMMENTS]

- sfhandvel2rsf < handvels.txt o1=0 d1=.001 n1=3000 > handvel.rsf

- The program converts time samples from ms to s

- The rsf output file will have traces equal to the number
of CMP locations in handvel.txt. You need to interploate
between traces for a denser grid e.g. using sfremap1

- This program uses sfspline for interpolation.
