Program sfcrssemb3d | CRS-based semblance for 3D
[SYNOPSIS]
sfcrssemb3d < inDags_.rsf dataSq=inDagsSq_.rsf > sembFile_.rsf xapp=1 yapp=1 dipappx=11 dipappy=11 coher=11 scatnum=1
[COMMENTS]
Several CIGs are used simultaneously. Dip-angle sections corresponding to the same 
dip-angle compose a subvolume. The subvolume allows calculating semblance in the
scattering-angle direction along reflection boundaries.

Input:
inDags_.rsf   - 3D dip-angle gathers - stack in the scattering-angle direction
inDagsSq_.rsf - stack of amplitude squares in the scattering-angle direction

Working with just dip-angle gathers use default value of "scatnum" parameter

Output:
sembFile_.rsf - crs-based semblance file; has the same dimensions as the input files

[PARAMETERS]
int     | coher | =11 |   | 	height of a vertical window for semblance calculation 
file    | dataSq | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
int     | dipappx | =11 |   | 	number of traces in the x-dip direction processed simultaneously 
int     | dipappy | =11 |   | 	number of traces in the y-dip direction processed simultaneously 
int     | scatnum | =1 |   | 	shows how many traces were stacked in the scattering angle direction; 
       if the stack was normalized use the default value 
    
int     | xapp | =1 |   | 	number of CIGs in the inline-direction processed simultaneously 
int     | yapp | =1 |   | 	number of CIGs in the crossline-direction processed simultaneously
