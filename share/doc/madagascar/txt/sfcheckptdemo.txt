Program sfcheckptdemo | RTM with checkpointing in 2D acoustic media
[SYNOPSIS]
sfcheckptdemo < Fv.rsf > Fw.rsf p1=Fp1.rsf p2=Fp2.rsf nb=20 nt= dt= fm=20.0 ft=0 jt=1 verb=n kt= nob=(int)log2f(nt)
[COMMENTS]
The real value of checkpointing technology resides in the backpropagation with
viscoacoustic and viscoelastic wave equation, where the wavefield 
reconstruction method using saved boundaries fails. Here, we only
demonstrate how to implement it in acoustic media without dissipation.
