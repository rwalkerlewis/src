Program sfocor3d | 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfocor3d < Fwfl.rsf opr=Fopr.rsf > Fcor.rsf verb=n adj=n ocox=0.0 ocoy=0.0 ocoz=0.0 ntlag=100 nxlag=0 nylag=0 nzlag=0
[COMMENTS]
Oriented correlation
wfl [file] : is taken from stdin
opr [file] : is taken from  "opr"
requires both files to have the same dimensions
correlation is computed at coordinates (ocox,ocoy,ocoz)
the (half) lags are: ntlag, nxlag, nylag, nzlag
