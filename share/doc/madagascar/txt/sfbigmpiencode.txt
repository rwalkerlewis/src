Program sfbigmpiencode | shot encoding with arbitrary phase and amplitude weights using MPI on a distributed cluster 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfbigmpiencode encode=Fencode.rsf nx= ny= dy= dx= ox= oy= verb=n dprefix= eprefix= shots=
[COMMENTS]


Use mpiencode if your shots are on the same grid prior to encoding.

Use bigmpiencode if your shots are not on a single grid prior to encoding.
YOUR SHOTS MUST ALL FALL ONTO THE SAME REGULAR GRID.  BigMPIENCODE does not do any
shot interpolation.

Data axes - X, Y, W
