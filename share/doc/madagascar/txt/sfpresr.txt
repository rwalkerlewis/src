Program sfpresr | 2-D simplest-form post-stack Kirchhoff time modeling and migration. 
[SYNOPSIS]
sfpresr < in.rsf > out.rsf vel=vel.rsf adj=y aa=n sw=0 v0=
[COMMENTS]
Suppose the input_image & output_data or input_data & output_image have the same dimensions, samplings.
The dottest has been past. 
[PARAMETERS]
bool    | aa | =n |  [y/n] | 	yes: apply reciprocal antialiaising operator 
bool    | adj | =y |  [y/n] | 	yes: migration, no: modeling 
int     | sw | =0 |   | 	if > 0, select a branch of the antialiasing operation 
float   | v0 | = |   | 	constant velocity (if no velocity=) 
string  | vel | = |   | 	velocity file (auxiliary input file name)
