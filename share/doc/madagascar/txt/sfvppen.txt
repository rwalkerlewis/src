[COMMENTS]

Although it is perhaps not obvious, this program can be used to
"Capture the screen". Ie, you play with Pen options until you
get something you like, and then you can use those options with
this program to make a new vplot file that without any options
will draw the same thing.

[PARAMETERS]
string  | align | = |   | 	aligns plot accoording to xy:
       x is one of l, r, c, u for left, right, center, unaligned
       y is one of b, t, c, u for bottom, top, center, unaligned.
       In all cases the given point is aligned to have coordinate zero. 
bool    | background | = |  [y/n] | 	
bool    | big | = |  [y/n] | 	if y, expand the size of the device's screen (and hence
       outermost clipping window) to nearly infinity (bad for rotated
       style!) 
int     | bit | =0 |   | 	if > 0,  then bit raster is used with bit the color 
bool    | blast | =y |  [y/n] | 	if y, don't try to compact the output.  If n, compaction will
       be done.  Compaction does run-length encoding and compacts repeated
       lines.  Compaction can make the vplot file considerably smaller, but
       it also takes longer to create the file.
