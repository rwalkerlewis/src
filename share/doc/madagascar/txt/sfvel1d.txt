Program sfvel1d | Hungs a 1d velocity function from the Water bottom.
[SYNOPSIS]
sfvel1d < in.rsf mask=mask1.rsf > out.rsf wb=wbot.rsf vel=1.5
[COMMENTS]
Should work for 2D models



stdin    1D velocity function to be used 
file mask [required]   The water bottom is read from the mask file.
1 above the WB
0 bellow the WB

stdout The output velocity model has dimensions of the mask file.
vel [1.5]    velocity to use above the horizon (usually water velocity)
