Program sffraclr2test | Complex lowrank decomposition for 2-D constant-Q visco-acoustic wave equation. (Testing for exact disperison relation)
[SYNOPSIS]
sffraclr2test < vel.rsf fft=fft.rsf left=left.rsf > right.rsf seed=time(NULL eps=1.e-4 npk=20 dt= c0= w0= rev=false mode=0 sign=0 approx=true
[PARAMETERS]
        | approx | =true |   | 	use Tieyuan's approximation
        | c0 | = |   | 	reference velocity
        | dt | = |   | 	time step
        | eps | =1.e-4 |   | 	tolerance
file    | fft | = |   | 	auxiliary input file name
file    | left | = |   | 	auxiliary output file name
        | mode | =0 |   | 	mode of propagation: 0 is viscoacoustic (default); 1 is loss-dominated; 2 is dispersion dominated; 3 is acoustic
        | npk | =20 |   | 	maximum rank
        | rev | =false |   | 	reverse propagation
        | seed | =time(NULL |   | 	
        | sign | =0 |   | 	sign of solution: 0 is positive, 1 is negative
        | w0 | = |   | 	reference frequency
